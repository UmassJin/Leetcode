##### [ Longest Increasing Subsequence ] (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-3-longest-increasing-subsequence/) 

The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given 

sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. 

For example, length of LIS for { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
