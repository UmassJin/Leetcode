Majority Element: A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Write a function which takes an array and emits the majority element (if it exists), otherwise prints NONE as follows:

```python
   I/P : 3 3 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
   O/P : 4

   I/P : 3 3 4 2 4 4 2 4
   O/P : NONE
```
