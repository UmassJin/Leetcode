#####Find k closest elements to a given value 

Given a sorted array arr[] and a value X, find the k closest elements to X in arr[]. 
Examples:
```
Input: K = 4, X = 35
       arr[] = {12, 16, 22, 30, 35, 39, 42, 
               45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56}
Output: 30 39 42 45
```
Note that if the element is present in array, then it should not be in output, only the other closest elements are required.

In the following solutions, it is assumed that all elements of array are distinct.
